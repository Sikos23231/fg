-- The Authenticator manages access to HTTP URLs. By default it allows access to all clients.
-- To restrict access you will need to specify what permissions are required for a particular page
-- in the router::register() call e.g. GET = {} means that no permissions are required to perform
-- a GET request on a particular HTTP resource. It is completely up to the user how these are stored
-- in the table for each object and how the Authenticator manages them.
-- Please make sure that resources are released in Authenticator:onSessionClose() if any resources
-- are allocated during authentication.
